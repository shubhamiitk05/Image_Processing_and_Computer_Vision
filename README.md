# Image Processing

## About Project
This repository contains the 8-week project offered by Stamatics Society at IIT Kanpur.

## Project Overview
The project covers various topics in image processing, including sampling and quantization, image enhancement, spatial domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, edge detection, and image segmentation using ML algorithms.

## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 focused on basic Probability concepts as they are useful in image processing.

## Assignment 2
### Jigsaw Solver
In this assignment, we worked on solving jigsaw puzzles using image processing techniques. The input image, 'jigsaw.jpg,' contained misaligned portions and sections. By rearranging the sub-matrices of the image, we solved the puzzle. The Google Colab file [IP2_A2_Q1](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Image_Processing/blob/main/Assignment%202/210787__jigsaw_solver.ipynb) contains the code and outputs the solved image.

### Dot Matrix Display
We implemented a dot matrix display for numbers using circular discs. Each dot represented a pixel with a radius of 25 pixels. The dot matrix image had a size of 300x500 pixels and was grayscale. The Google Colab file [IP2_A2_Q2](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Image_Processing/blob/main/Assignment%202/210787__dotmatrix_display.ipynb) takes a 6-digit number as input and outputs the dot matrix representation of the last two digits.

## Assignment 3
### Nettoyeur de Goutti√®res
In this assignment, we worked on cleaning the gutters of scanned books, magazines, or notebooks. Shadows in the gutter were removed using image processing techniques. The file [IP_A3_Q1](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Image_Processing/blob/main/Assignment%203/IP3_Q1_210787.ipynb) takes the input as an integer (1, 2, or 3) corresponding to the provided images 'gutters1.jpg', 'gutters2.jpg', or 'gutters3.jpg' and outputs the cleaned image.

### Friendly Neighbourhood Engineer
For this task, we enhanced night images captured by battery-powered CCTV cameras in remote villages. The goal was to discover possible traces of theft by processing and enhancing the images. The file [IP_A3_Q2](https://github.com/priyanshu11137/Image_Processing/blob/main/Assignment%203/IP3_Q2_210787.ipynb) takes the input as an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponding to the provided CCTV images 'cctv1.jpg', 'cctv2.jpg', 'cctv3.jpg', or 'cctv4.jpg' and outputs the respective enhanced images.
